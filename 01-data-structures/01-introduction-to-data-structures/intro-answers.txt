for Line:

1) My data structure allows developers to access and manipulate the data by exposing some methods that will allow me to insert the names of people in a conteptual line represented by the class created.
The "join" function allows the class' user to add someone to the data structure, as you would get in a line.
The "leave" function allows someone that matches the name person to be removed from the line.
The functions, "front", "middle", and "back" allow someone to see who is located where with respect to the current people within the line.
These functions represent the person located at the relative position within the line.

2) To search for a specific element in the data structure, we would search for it by using the built in "search" function in order to see if said person exists in the structure.

3) The line could also represent any sort of line at a cashier, bank, amusement park. Or, the order in which an assembly line parts are going down a conveyer belt.

for Screen:

1) The data structure allows us to access and manipulate the data through the "insert" method. It allows me to insert a pixel, at a specified (x, y) location on the Screen by specifying where on the screen the pixel shall be located.

2) If a developer wanted to find an element in the data structure, they would have to use the "at" method, specify an (x, y), and see if a pixel exists there on the Screen.

3) The Screen can represent a matrix of numbers, where the number is represented by each pixel information at each (x, y) coordinate.
